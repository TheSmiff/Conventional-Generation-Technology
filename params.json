Smith**](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/thomasjsmithmeng) @TheSmiff\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\nThe aims of the module were:\r\n* To introduce the conventional technologies used for generating electricity,\r\n* To develop awareness of the technical problems associated with operation of different types of power plants,\r\n* To gain understanding of the complex systems involved in generation of electricity,\r\n* To challenge the conventional views towards power generation industry,\r\n* To get novel ideas supporting the sustainability of power generation.\r\n\r\nThis included generating two sets of coursework. The first was to generate a future energy strategy for an assigned country. This took place in an individual report and a group presentation.\r\n\r\nFind the brief here: [Brief.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Conventional-Generation-Technology/blob/master/ELEC6115_Assignement1_2013.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nFind the individual report here: [Report.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Conventional-Generation-Technology/blob/master/Thomas%20Smith%20Energy%20Policy.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nFind the presentation here: [Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Conventional-Generation-Technology/blob/master/Italian%20Energy%20Policy.pptx?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second coursework focussed on thermodynamics of steam plant.\r\n\r\nFind the brief here: [Brief.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Conventional-Generation-Technology/blob/master/Assignment2_2012_steam_plant_part_II.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nFind the report here: [Report.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/Conventional-Generation-Technology/blob/master/SteamPlant.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nFor original simulation files: [Thomas J Smith](mailto:tjs1g10@ecs.soton.ac.uk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
